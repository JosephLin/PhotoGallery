# PhotoGallery

- Number of photos?
- How big are the photos? should we create low-res thumbnails?
- always two columns? Fixed/proportional spacing? Fixed/proportional cell size?
- Cell should be 4:3? What about portrait photos? Aspect zoom?
- intentionally not want status bar? why?

# Grid

- thumbnail should expand into fullscreen detail image
- crossfade-in black background
- what kind of animation curve? ease in-out? overshoot and bounce?
- what kind of path? linear?

- haptic feedback? sound effect? 3D touch & peek?

- transition to detail with tools or no tools? remember preference?

# Detail

- What should portrait photo look like? Aspect fit to the entire background (behind bars)?

- Pan left-right between photos
- Paged (i.e. auto-snapped, only allow pan to +/- 1 page)
- Parallex? probably not

- Pan up-down to dismiss (move on both x and y axis?)
- on up-down pan, crossfade background to grid view
- let go (far enough from center) to shrink to thumbnail

- Zooming?
- allow pan between photos / pan to dismiss when zoomed?

- interactable / interruptible transition
- Update animation frame
- grid should scroll with selection


# TODO
- Zoom
- debug menu
